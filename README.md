# Classic Snakes & Ladders Game

This is the classic Snakes and Ladder game being developed with Python 3.7.

It is a multiplayer board game in which players have small chips of differentiating
colors which they begin by placing on position 1 of the grid.

Players roll a dice to determine their move.
A player moves from position 1 towards 100 on the board.
The aim of the game is to reach to 100th position first.

On the way from 1 to 100, there are snakes which eat the players and bring
down to dower position and ladders which take a player raise to upward position.
